**AskEIVA** is an enterprise-grade, AI-native knowledge orchestration platform built using **C# / .NET 10 Clean Architecture** and **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** principles. It is engineered to ingest, chunk, vectorize, and map dense subsea survey instrumentation documentation, software manuals (NaviPac, NaviScan, NaviEdit, NaviModel), and historical helpdesk records into a traceable, highly contextual, and cross-referenced GraphRAG intelligence ecosystem.

## 🏛️ Project Vision & Evolution

AskEIVA addresses the critical challenge of technical discovery within complex marine engineering domains. Moving beyond traditional isolated vector search tools, the platform focuses on building an interconnected **Topological Context Mesh** that mirrors real-world relations between specific software releases, hardware components, and operational support tickets.

### 🔄 The Leap: Python Prototype to Enterprise .NET 10
* **Prototype Stage:** Built as a Python/Streamlit script executing standalone text processing runs.
* **Production Architecture:** Completely re-engineered into a strictly decoupled C# solution. By separating core domain behavior from infrastructure boundaries, the platform provides the EIVA engineering team with an easily maintainable codebase designed for horizontal scaling, strict type safety, and real-time background execution loops.

## 🏗️ Clean Architecture Breakdown

The solution structural design isolates domain laws from external storage frameworks, infrastructure dependencies, and UI rendering elements, splitting the project into four distinct layers:

```text
📁 src/
├── 📁 AskEiva.Domain/         # Pure domain models (TicketNode, TextChunk), Value Objects, & Repository Contracts. Zero external dependencies.
├── 📁 AskEiva.Application/    # Use cases, CQRS Command/Query Handlers (MediatR), and orchestrations (e.g., IngestDocumentationCommand).
├── 📁 AskEiva.Infrastructure/ # Concrete adapters: Weaviate vector operations, HtmlAgilityPack public scrapers, and GraphQL engines.
└── 📁 AskEiva.WebUI/          # Blazor Interactive Server UI (MudBlazor), real-time log monitors, and network graph visualizations.
